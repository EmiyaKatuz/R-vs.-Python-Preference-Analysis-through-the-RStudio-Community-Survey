# R vs. Python Preference Analysis through the RStudio Community Survey

## Overview
This repository presents an in-depth analysis of the RStudio Community Survey data, comparing R and Python usage among data science professionals. The project integrates multiple statistical models to identify key factors and forecast future language preferences.

## Data Source
The primary data for this analysis is sourced from the repository <https://github.com/rstudio/r-community-survey>, which is publicly available on GitHub. The survey gathers responses from a diverse global community of R users and covers a range of topics including:
- Demographic details (e.g., occupation, gender, experience)
- Usage patterns of R and Python
- Opinions on language preferences, including frequency of use, enjoyment, and recommendations

Data from multiple survey years were combined and processed to harmonize variables and account for survey design differences, providing a robust foundation for trend analysis.

## Outcome
